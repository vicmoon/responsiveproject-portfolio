         <p>
          The Dictionary is very interesting to build, even more so for someone in love with languages, 
          words and meanings! I liked learning to integrate the 2 APIs used in this project a lot. 
          The moment when the console gets a response is magical!

          <p>
            I loved working on this project! Ever since I remember myself, I
            have been inspired by creative people, those who seem to be thinking and looking at life 
            differently. Those who bring fresh ideas into the world, while being
            immersed in the world as well. I think that this way of living is extremely
            interesting. I dedicated this project to some of the creative minds
            I have learned from to listen, see and think creatively.

         <p>
          Working on this project was so much fun ! If a few months ago I
          would be really concerned whenever a bug comes up or I get stuck ,
          now I know that most bugs have a solution or a reason, it's just the
          mind which needs a break. The date and time on the internet are
          certainly looking better with Moment.js. Although modern
          applications require libraries which take less space,
          <a href="https://momentjs.com/"> Moment.js </a> is still being
          downloaded at an astonishing 12 million times per week!

       <p>
        It has been a while since my last and first landing page and I am
        surprised by the progress! Last time it took three weeks to build a
        basic page and now one week :) I would encourage everyone out there
        learning to code or learning anything else for that matter - don't
        give up and the results will show up!

     <a href="https://illustrious-beignet-228d77.netlify.app/ " target="_blank" alt=" React Weather App" ><h2> React Weather App</h2></a>
     <p>
      Why another weather app? Well, because using the Open Weather API
      makes for a perfect learning experience. This one has a fresh
      interface with vibrant colours and a style inspired by airports. I
      like the frenetic movement, the sounds, the voices, the timetables.
      This time I've learned how to use
      <a href="https://reactjs.org/"> React </a> - a Javascript library
      for building user interfaces. It has been very interesting to learn
      about components, external components, Ajax, node.js, props and
      States. The web is slowly but surely becoming clearer to me.

     <a href="https://vanillaweathersearch.netlify.app/ " target="_blank" alt=" JavaScript Weather App" ><h2> Javascript Weather App</h2></a>
     <p>
      Does the world need another weather app? Probably not. Did I know
            how to code one, before trying to do it? No! After 2 months of
            tedious work, when every single solved problem felt like an
            incredible achivement, I made it! Check it out, it's precise and up
            to date :)

   <p>
    My first landing page was a huge achievement for me. Looking back
            now I am proud of myself for having chosen this road, against all
            odds and expectations. I am looking forward to more learning and
            using my new skills to create interesting, useful stuff.
